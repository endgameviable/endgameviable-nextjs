    review: Number one on the [AFI 100 Thrills](https://www.afi.com/afis-100-years-100-thrills/) list. First time I've ever watched it all the way through. "It's hot as fresh milk." She's a thief! Frantic music. Are we meant to think she's imagining these voices while she drives or are these actual events happening elsewhere? Huh, The Iconic Scene is less than halfway into the movie, wasn't expecting that. Such an unusual structure to this movie. Starts one way then completely changes to something else. The field of psychiatry always seems to play a prominent role in these older movies. This actor at the end who has to deliver all this dry expositional dialog to explain everything has a tough role. Hard to decide how to rate this. I wasn't particularly affected by it. I examined it like one of the stuffed birds that Norman Bates made in the movie. I'm not entirely sure why the AFI ranked it higher than The Birds. I guess just because it had never been done before.

    summary: At least they saved the love birds.
    review: Now consulting the [AFI 100 Thrills](https://www.afi.com/afis-100-years-100-thrills/) list to find early horror films. I have a vague memory of being scared by this movie on a weekend re-run seen on the tiny black-and-white kitchen television as a kid. My aunt was terrified of birds, and I find them slightly discomforting to this day. Anyway. Ms. Daniels is quite the obsessive stalker, you see. Why does this dude in California have a New England accent. Seriously _what_ is this lady's deal? A tetanus shot for bird claws? Read a book, 1960s people! OMG she's a pathological liar, you see. Jessica Tandy. I'm finding all the verbal chess pretty unexpected and amusing. A surprising amount of the movie is a light entertainment afternoon soap opera. Little Veronica Cartwright, who later plays Lambert in Alien. Impressive composite work to overlay all the birds into these scenes (using "yellowscreen" techniques, apparently). There's no music. The birds sound synthetic, because they were created on a synthesizer. The children's song goes, "Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, Hey donnie-dostle-tee knickety-knackety, Rustical quality, Now, now, now." There must have been at least 50 cigarettes lit and smoked in this movie. I noticed quite early on there's a lot of actors stepping on each others' lines, but I think it's intentional to keep it snappy, so there's never any verbal pauses. (Some mid-Atlantic accents, too.) Tipi Hedren's face is always slightly out of focus in closeups. Impressive overhead shot of the town and the burning gas station. Yeesh these loud synthesized bird sounds are creepy and unsettling. It's such a long movie for 1963! And these old movies just STOP when they're done, don't they? Anyway, it's pretty good. Surprisingly suspenseful, without any music or jump scares, and a surprisingly engaging, if quaint, story. (Make sure to check out the trailer on the Wikipedia page, too. Funny stuff.)

    summary: A good reason to replace VHS technology.
    review: Halloween Night Scares. I remember this as one of the scariest horror movies I've ever seen, but after finding the original Japanese version a bit meh, I wondered if that was a false memory, so I had to check. It's got the green The Matrix look. Seems more grounded in reality, which makes it feel scarier than the Japanese version, which was a bit more fantastical (both the characters were psychics or something). Definitely creepier imagery. Somewhat better characters, although the ex-husband is kind of a jerk. There's a lot of detective work and not very much action. And I'm still not sure I get how the videotape ended up being cursed. Overall it's not as good as I remember. I almost fell asleep near the end. I must have been in a highly suggestible mood when I first watched it. I can't remember where I read this, but perhaps it was memorable simply because it was so different from the two decades of horror slashers that preceded it, and ushered in a period of more psychological than monster-based horror. I've marked it as canonical for being the first movie to introduce Japanense horror to the West. Also, I swear I remember a scene at the end where they put the tape in a video rental store, but it was missing in this version and ended ambiguously. Maybe that's just how I _wanted_ it to end. (I'm pretty sure DVDs had replaced VHS by the time this movie came out and Netflix had replaced video rental stores. I'm almost positive I first watched this on a Netflix DVD rental.) Also, Samara clearly inspired the video game FEAR.

    summary: Sometimes the original isn't better.
    review: Halloween Night Scares. I thought I'd watch the original Japanese version, with the expectation that it would be scarier than the English version, which I remember as one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, if not _the_ scariest. I remember a lot of _creeeeeepy_ imagery, and I just assumed the original Japanese horror (which I think of as creepier than English horror) would go even further. But as it turns out there's very little creepiness in the original, and it's a slightly different story, I think. It's got weirdly silent interior ambiences, like older movies relying on foley work. I guess this is where the popularity of the industrial ambient horror score originated from. I have to admit I'm finding it somewhat hard to follow, and my attention keeps wandering. Like, it's not clear how any of this is related to a videotape. Not sure they addressed that in the English version either, actually. I have a sinking feeling that if I re-watch the English remake, I won't like it anymore. Cool end title music though. I've marked this as canonical for being the mainstream introduction of Japanese horror to the world.

    summary: Nobody ever listens to the dogs.
    review: Halloween Night Scares. Rewatching one of the scariest horror movies I can ever recall seeing. The classic survival horror isolation story, often imitated, here done just about as well as it can be done. I'm reminded that there was an early episode of The X-Files that borrowed _heavily_ from this movie. A rare John Carpenter film where someone else is credited for the music, and it sets a creepier tone than usual (there is still plenty of the signature monotonic John Carpenter synth sound though). That classic 80s anamorphic look. Classic red and blue lighting. Isolation, distrust, claustrophobia, and tension. Still great, though maybe a little dated now.

    review: Vincent Price in a supporting role (I believe this movie essentially launched his career). Odd structure to the movie, starting with a murder and working backwards. Interesting subtext about the speed of scientific discovery and whether it's too fast. Luckily they didn't know about the Internet back then. The laboratory set looked like it must have blown the entire special effects budget of the time. Anyway, it's actually a decent movie. Surprisingly good performance from Patricia Owens. I daresay she carried the whole movie. (Incidentally I've never seen the entire Jeff Goldblum version because it's gross.)

    summary: This is why you should get an Android phone.
    review: I just happened to finish the audiobook this morning, and I just happened to notice there was a movie version. I didn't expect it to be very good. Netflix doesn't have a great reputation for original programming. They can afford great cameras and sets and effects, but they tend to scrimp on the writing and actors. Right away, this kid's voiceover narration isn't anywhere near as good as Will Patten's narration in the audiobook. The younger kid actor is much better at reading than the older kid actor. This was a good example of a movie that was ruined for me by reading the book first. I found the movie quite dull, while I found the audiobook riveting. I doubt that I would have liked the movie even if I'd seen it first, but at least I might have wondered what was going to happen next. None of the acting performances in the movie were as good as Will Patten's narrating of the audiobook.

    review: I mean, of course I'm going to watch Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, because I immediately thought that's what Rubber was supposed to be an homage to. I also suspected that Attack of the Killer Tomatoes would be a better movie, even though it's quite famous for being terrible, so I wanted to check my theory. It _is_ terrible. But it's also an unabashed comedy, with actual proper jokes and everything, beyond the main sarcastic one. The tomatoes actually aren't in the movie much--most of the comedy is about government ineptitude. It's got, you know, subtext. Social satire, even. Also a real helicopter crash. When I saw it, I thought, wow that was a weird stunt, I don't think they're supposed to do that; they wrecked a whole helicopter for this? Well, no they didn't. It was a big oops. "This ... may God help us ... is a cherry tomato." And yes, it's better than Rubber.

    summary: Not every idea needs to be a movie.
    review: Seen this mentioned a few times. Thought it sounded ridiculous. It is. It might have been a Monty Python sketch at one time in history. Except they would have known when to end the sketch. It reminds me of those NaNoWriMo dailies where you write down whatever fourth-wall-breaking nonsense is in your head to fill the required word count. I guess if you have enough money and/or the right connections, you can turn those pages into a film. Lucky us. It could also be what someone thinks a horror movie made by Rick & Morty might look like (not the makers of Rick & Morty, the characters Rick & Morty), and you can imagine them vehemently defending its integrity. The director is French, so maybe it's a translation issue. Maybe these jokes are hilarious and culturally relevant to a French or European audience. It's the kind of humor that feels like they're directly mocking the audience, like the art piece that's a banana taped to a wall, not the kind of humor where the audience is in on the joke. This movie [had a _half a million dollar_ budget](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Rubber#tab=summary). Can you imagine an earnest young filmmaker trying to start their career seeing that and thinking, They had a half million dollars and they did _that_ with it?? And they still had a prosperous career afterward?? What better example of the adage, It's not what you know, but _who_ you know, could there be? I watched this entire thing so nobody could say I didn't give it a chance and it's hard not to feel angry about it.

    summary: Ghosts looking for their gold.
    review: I'd heard of The Fog before but never had the vaguest clue what it was about or noticed anyone talking about it. It's atmospheric. The late-night swing jazz radio music backdrop behind everything gives it a sinister vibe. It's got an eclectic cast of characters. But Jamie Lee Curtis got demoted from the semi-strong female lead in Halloween to a hitchhiker sidekick. I guess this was the inspiration for The Secret World's Kingsmouth zone. The story rules that govern the capabilities of the spooky fog don't make much sense. The dated smoke effects undercut the tension somewhat. It's a nice idea, and I thought it started well, but the conclusion fell a bit flat for me.

    review: The fifth in the George A. Romero Living Dead series. I don't like found footage or handheld camera work in general so I was sure this was going to be terrible. What I will say, though, is that this is a found footage film created by professionals who know how to hire actors and  write scripts and block scenes for long takes. So in that sense it's automatically better than most. And, dammit, it's actually not bad. Limited motion sickness. Good characters. Decent story. Accurately bleak view of humanity. And it's another keen George A. Romero observation of society's faults (this time, in the area of media obsession and media trust and the rise of Internet journalism and populism). It pains me to say I kind of liked it. As with all the ones before, it's no masterpiece, but it's worth watching.

    summary: Zombie apocalypse, 2000s-style. The survivors live in Pittsburg with lots of guns.
    review: The next in the "Living Dead" movies, following twenty years after Day of the Dead from 1985, capitalizing on the peak zombie media years. I genuinely didn't know George A. Romero had directed so many of these canonical Dead movies. Here we can definitely see how much the George A. Romero and The Walking Dead universes are creatively intertwined, in the sense that they both highlight life _after_ the zombie apocalypse. DC and Marvel, so to speak. The same, but legally distinct. Wikipedia tells me the first The Walking Dead comic came out a year before this movie. Anyway on to the movie. Nice prologue. It's a bleak vision of humanity. You can tell by the desaturation. It's Mad Max Thunderdome with zombies. More action movie than ever before. It's the continuing theme of humans being humans ("humans being"), this time featuring class warfare. Also smarter zombies. Somebody did a fairly impressive imitation of a Wilhelm Scream that wasn't an actual Wilhelm Scream at 1:14:23. This installment wasn't fantastic (none of them are, so far), but it was a decent cast of characters and a sufficiently acerbic metaphor for humanity so it was good enough.

    summary: Investigating the murder of a psychic for inexplicable reasons.
    review: Searching for horror in 1975. Peak Italian giallo horror, according to Wikipedia. Seems like more of a plain old murder mystery to me. From the same director as Suspiria. The ever-popular horror POV shot from the killer. Lots of 70s red paint for blood. 70s film stock devoid of any blue. 70s blues funk band score (Goblin), with instruments slightly out of tune sometimes. I find myself wondering why this pianist is investigating the murder instead of the police. He wasn't shown to know the victim right? Just doesn't seem like there's any motivation to account for characters' behavior, or story to tie any of the scenes together. The classic "stuff happening is not necessarily a plot" syndrome. Ah well. On reflection, I suppose you could say this is a horror in the sense that it's a killer stalking a series of victims, like the teen slasher, except that none of them are teens and they aren't in a confined space.

    review: After watching Night of the Living Dead, I found the next one in the mythos, Dawn of the Dead, on an obscure channel called ReDiscover Television after a Roku search on my television. Inexplicably, [Rediscover](https://rediscovertv.com/home) is apparently a family-friendly channel. Anyway, the zombies look more like circus clowns with all that face makeup amirite. Funny how gas pump nozzles haven't changed since 1978. Seems to lack much of a plot. The characters are just kind of drifting through the movie's runtime, attempting to survive through means that don't entirely make much logical sense. Nodded off a bit in the second half during the big tractor trailer endeavor. I didn't understand what they were doing or why the helicopter needed to be hovering overhead wasting fuel the whole time. I previously thought that Day of the Dead was the origin of all the The Walking Dead tropes but you can see it starting here; that is, the basic throughline of humans versus zombies turning into humans versus humans, and the ultimate end directly tied to human folly. Wait what they had blood pressure monitor kiosks in 1978?

    review: After seeing Shaun of the Dead, I wanted to see the other George A. Romero zombie mythos-defining movies. I was going to work backwards from Day of the Dead, which I'd seen a few weeks ago, but I couldn't find Dawn of the Dead _anywhere_, so it was Night of the Living Dead then. I think I've seen this movie before, but I don't remember it. I believe Max's version of this film is the Criterion/MoMA remastered 4K version. It occurs to me that these older horror movies could be considerably improved for a modern audience if they simply remixed the sound. Leave the dialog, augment the badly-recorded, sparse foley sound effects, but most importantly rescore the music. It's mainly the old-fashioned midrange-heavy music score blaring frantically over the long and slow action scenes that make old horror movies so cheesy. Also the foley work from before they made flesh hits sound like Hollywood rather than reality. Judith O'Dea looks a little like Kim Raver from 24. A surprisingly large portion of the runtime is hammering things on doors and windows. Wait it took him an hour to look upstairs? These two dudes just appeared from the basement? The balding father dude looks like Rob Corddry. Showing this television report must have been a technical challenge--I don't think you could just film a television screen in 1968? (I'm not sure you can today, either, actually.) I imagine they either had to composite it and/or put some kind of cut-out facade of a television panel in front of a projection screen. Feels like this movie is about six hours long. The rifle sounds like a pellet gun. Overall, surprisingly watchable with some surprising twists. But others have done this story better. (Including George A. Romero.) I wish it didn't feel like it takes six hours to tell a 20-minute story though.

    review: Figured I'd finally watch the other two movies in that Simon Pegg/Edgar Wright trilogy thing. This one is okay but I didn't really get into it. The amount of shaky cam is absurd at times. So much so that it's hard to tell if it was just the standard of the time, a Bad Boys homage, or it was deliberately above-and-beyond the over-the-top to make another joke. The epilepsy-inducing transitions and flashbacks were a bit much this time. Another joke? Maybe, but it came at the expense of physically hurting my eyeballs. Unlike Shaun of the Dead, this one seemed like more of a straight parody.

    summary: Still funny.
    review: A rewatch because I'm tired of trying to find decent new horror movies. Specifically I wanted to see just how much this influenced Tucker & Dale, and how it handled the mixing of comedy and horror. It's a more expertly crafted movie, and it genuinely manages to be a comedy with horror elements, instead of the other way around, without turning into parody. I can't think of any other movies that pull that off. Didn't like all the skaky cam though.

    summary: Hope you're into documentary-style and evangelicals.
    review: The search for a 2010 horror movie. Documentary style. Handheld camera style. I don't like this style. Didn't cameras have stabilization in them by 2010? It seems not. Started fast-forwarding after 6 minutes. Not a terrible idea to have an evangelical showman preacher confronting demons, but, you know, the documentary/reality style and the shaky motion-sickness-inducing pictures ruin it for me. Actual documentaries aren't nearly as shaky as this.

    review: Searching for a 2012 horror movie. Somewhat expository dialog at times. Classically broody goth atmosphere. Coventry carol is best carol. Strong character drama. Mystery. Moral ambiguity. The curse of the vampire. Gothic romance. Riveting. Then more riveting. Then an extra helping of riveting piled on top of the previous mountain of riveting. One of the best vampire movies. Maybe ever? Just maybe. Assuming you like gothic vampire mythos in the vein of Interview With The Vampire, but better. (Turns out, it's the same director.)

    review: Searching for a 2012 horror movie and this one was [ranked sixth in popularity by IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature,tv_movie&release_date=2012-01-01,2012-12-31&genres=horror). My initial 5-minute impression was that it would be more style than substance, more mood than story, which turned out to be accurate. Generally speaking, a haunted house story needs compelling characters to be the haunters or the hauntees, or perhaps a compelling reason to unravel the mystery of the haunting. This movie doesn't seem to realize that. Everyone's flat and emotionless, in the Downton Abbey style. Multiple, lengthy scenes of looking around to find jump scares. Disappointing. I ended up fast forwarding through most of it.

    review: Almost positive I started watching this once, but don't remember finishing it. Ha their "fixer upper" looks like an exact replica of a dilapidated house on my family's West Virginia property when I was a kid. Surely I'm not the only one rooting for all these college kids to die? Mixing comedy and horror is a tricky business. It makes sense for a horror to have comedy in it, but a comedy with horror in it usually turns out to be more of a parody. This one's pretty funny though. Classic mistaken identity humor. Also surprisingly touching at times.

    review: More like horror-adjacent. Couldn't sleep so I watched a 70s film to fall asleep. Was curious to see this because I vaguely remember liking the 2004 remake with Nicole Kidman. "Stepford Wife" is one of those terms you've heard all your life but didn't really know what it meant until you saw the movie (or read the book, which I haven't). Super 70s station wagons on display. Annnnd I fell asleep in the middle. And they say only the younger generation speaks truth to power and confronts delicate social issues. This movie hits issues in the face with a sledgehammer. "The 6 o'clock news scares me every night." More evidence that all generations are the same.

More mood than story. Couldn't force myself to care about any of the personality-free characters. Started fast-forwarding about halfway through.

    summary: Surprisingly watchable psychological drama, and the origin of the jump scare.
    review: Trying to wash the bizarre taste of Cronos out of my mouth, I saw Cat People from 1942 in the Max recommended movie list, and didn't realize there was a version that preceded the Nastassja Kinski/Malcom McDowell version, so I watched it. Nobody ever listens to the cats. I imagine this was a scandalous movie for a variety of reasons in 1942, but that might just be my media-distorted view of past generations. Otherwise it's surprisingly watchable, though it isn't very scary, except for the lack of assurances that no animals were harmed in the making of the movie. But wait, there's a genuine jump scare at 44:15! The first one in movie history? [It is!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_scare#In_film) It's no wonder generations of people feared psychology after movies like this. Nice touch that Irena's costuming changes from light to dark over the course of the movie.

The horror is all body horror stuff which is gross even when it looks fake, unless you're really into the art and science of prosthetic gags. But mostly the story is ... stuff happening that doesn't make much sense. Got bored and started fast forwarding. I guess it's kind of a vampire story? I think? Anyway, it's not for me.

    review: A Netflix original, and a Stephen King (and Joe Hill) thing I hadn't seen. A ragtag bunch of regular folks get lost in tall grass and things get spooky. My kind of horror story. The sound mix got on my nerves because they made the distant voices too quiet to hear even though they were part of the conversations. Not exactly powerhouse acting performances. The setup is better than the conclusion. Somehow it morphed from an interesting supernatural mystery to a plain old fashioned survival chase full of gimmicky scares, and I struggled to pay attention beyond the halfway point.

    summary: Character-driven period western with a survival horror twist.
    review: Star power. I like a good western, and there aren't many, but this is one of them. It's a minimalist character-driven period western that only veers into survival horror in the final act. A posse of eclectic characters on the trail of (as far as I know, entirely fictional) mute, cannabalistic, cave-dwelling kidnappers, who kill with ghost-like savagery, like proto-Predators, so it's okay for the audience to view them as straight-up soulless video game monsters (or at least, that's certainly the hope). Somewhat clumsily distances itself from the problematic tropes of older westerns, but doesn't go as far as re-writing history. Another horror director who wants to do his own music. Luckily there isn't much, except the oddly out-of-place operatic end title music. Character performances drive most of this movie. The lack of Hollywood-style over-the-top sound effects and music during the scary bits somehow makes it even scarier. Can't decide if I liked it or loved it. It's an indescribably odd duck.

Blue Ridge Mountains? Suitably creepy antagonist. Suitably creepy driving alone at night situation. Taps into the modern cultural fear of the vaguely rural white man who acts like the serial killer in every true crime docudrama. The key to this kind of survival story working is for the victim to survive using their own ingenuity, and they mostly did. Lots of tension. I liked it.

    review: Just checking the box. I believe this is the origin of the unexpected explosion in popularity of the low budget "group of teens dying one by one" genre that makes studio executives salivate. Never wanted to see it. Never expected to like it. Turns out, I didn't like it. Nice to confirm the confirmation bias. I don't like teen movies even when they _aren't_ getting murdered. Anyway on to the movie. Wobbly handheld POV shots from the killer. Low budget. Cheesy music. Cheesy 70s acting and dialog. Cheesy Kevin Bacon. It occurs to me the teen slasher is a survival horror at its core, which I like, but it seems to be filtered to remove any stakes, which makes them boring. For example, the plot of Friday the 13th is essentially the same as the plot of Predator and Alien, and  while those movies keep me engaged and on the edge my seat, Friday the 13th doesn't. I have a lot of time to think these thoughts and write them down, because the movie's pacing is quite slow. On the plus side, I didn't see any obvious instances of characters acting dumb to advance the plot (not counting the killer, who conveniently forgot how to kill a few times). I also enjoyed how the killer just blurted out their backstory and rationale at the end even though nobody asked them. Finally, I did actually jump at the Carrie-style jump scare at the end, because I was editing this text instead of watching the screen, when the sudden blast of noise from the speaker made me jump.

    review: The search for a 1999 horror alternative to Blair Witch. A virtual reality gaming cautionary tale I never heard of, from back when virtual reality scared people. Star power. Cronenberg prioritizes the absurdly weird and grotesque more than a grounded story or characters. Has a 1950s black-and-white Martian science fiction feel. The surreal dialog is oddly compelling. The gross squicky organic creature gags are utterly irrelevant. But the warning about getting too immersed in games is still a valid message, regardless of the clumsiness (real life death threats against game developers are extremely common now). I didn't want to like this, but I kind of did.

    review: The grand tradition of the haunted house, and this time it's apparently an entire cinematic universe. Seems to be a more spiritualistic version of The X-Files. Nobody ever listens to the dog. The only thing that really distinguishes these movies from one another is the characters, and this family and these investigators are pretty flat Midwesterners. I mean you'd think a married couple of traveling paranormal investigating lecturers would be riveting, but they have all the personality of patent attorneys. Otherwise it goes down the list of required haunted house scenes and checks all the boxes. Easy for the mind to wander.

Otherwise, it's ... a mainstream 90s movie, with a lot of recognizable 90s actors, and a pre-hobbit Elijah Wood. Basically, it's Invasion of the Body Snatchers with high school kids instead of adults. Couldn't relate. Not very scary or interesting. Or funny. Fast forwarded through most of it. Amazing to me that a) I don't remember this movie existing and b) this was the 3rd-highest grossing horror movie of 1998. But then I don't see many alternatives.

    review: Another "elevated" horror movie referenced in Scream (2022). Never seen a movie begin with an obituary title card before. Cool camera trickery at the start. Another movie where "elevated" means quiet and slow with an ambient score. It's not really _about_ anything, except family grief, until a solid 1 hour and 15 minutes into the movie, which is a _long_ time to wait for a story hook. But it's pretty creepy if you can stand to wait that long. Then it takes a pretty hard left turn and it feels like two different movies smooshed together. Ended on a somewhat confusing note, but worth seeing.

    review: It was on my watch list for 2014 horror movies, and it was mentioned in Scream (2022) as an "elevated" horror film, so I had to watch it. Talk about yer STDs, amirite? Elevated, btw, means brooding with long, slow camera pans, pushes, and pulls. Creepy, but there's a bit of dream logic. The story rules don't quite make sense and there's no resolution which I guess makes it extra artful? Anyway it's not bad. It has a very 70s unglamorous look with a very 80s Stranger Things soundtrack.

    review: Deja vu. Ghostface is back for a new generation. Tolerably fresh, but it seems like just a few too many layers of self-referencing to be taken as seriously as the first one. I'm not sure a Gen Z teen slasher even makes sense, given that Gen Z never physically interacts with each other, do they? Shouldn't a modernized teen slasher be built around SWATing or doxxing or something?

    review: It's possible I first saw some or all of this in the 2000s. I don't remember. I have the controversial opinion that even self-aware teen slashers are still teen slashers, but I have to grudgingly admit there's some story and mystery and likable characters in this one (and, importantly for a movie, decent acting). I noted that, much like the demon voice in The Exorcist, the voice of the killer on the phone sounds more comical than scary. And thus a generation of horror movie parodies were born.

    review: What if there were a new crop of movie directors who were heavily inspired by M. Night Shymalan movies? What if they made A Quiet Place with even less dialog? What if they made a movie that completely revolves around one character's mysterious backstory that turns out to be exactly what you thought it was all along? Too many "wtf why" character moments for me. Fast forwarded through the second half.

There's a reason Freddy Krueger is the only thing anyone remembers from this franchise. Formulaic, boring, studio cash cow. Characters deliberately acting thick for the plot. A weirdly Home Alone vibe at the end. Johnny Depp's first movie.

Little character development or story. Poor sound mix. Repetitive John Carpenter music gets old fast. Jamie Lee Curtis's face and voice apparently haven't changed since 1978, which makes it look like her face was digitally superimposed onto a tiny body in this movie.

(Apparently, Tobe Hooper intentially made it to resemble a Hammer Horror film, which it does, in the sense that Hammer Horrors are also pretty cheesy.) Let's be honest here, if there wasn't a naked woman in this movie, nobody would have remembered it.

Sort of like a Buster Keaton silent movie horror. Very little dialog. I feel like one could make a 5-10 minute cut of this movie and still retain every nuance of it. This is just a director playing with cameras. Not to be utilized for entertainment purposes.

Peter Cushing's Baron Frankenstein is kind of a jerk. "I have seriously broken the law," is an actual line from this movie (1:10:43), reminding us that millennial-speak is seriously old-fashioned. Otherwise, I couldn't connect with this at all, no matter how hard the score worked to force me to feel things, and I'd be hard pressed to summarize the plot. Maybe I missed some context because this was only one in a series of these Hammer Frankenstein flicks.

They want us to believe this family has developed smart solutions but there are so many obvious ways the internal logic collapses. The number of times I said "wtf why" at my screen was well beyond tolerable limits. Still, it had some touching character moments. No interest in the sequel though.

An interesting idea, way better execution than Blair Witch, except that these characters remained in the house long after the point where it made any sense to stay in the house, thanks to the idiot boyfriend being all like "hey baby let's stay it's fine" while she's repeatedly saying "I hate it let's leave" every day for a month. Ugh. She's literally dragged to the attic screaming, and they _still_ stay another night. Bravo to the ghost, I say.

The next day I felt bad for abandoning it in the middle (after all, supposedly it's included in [1,001 movies to watch before you die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Movies_You_Must_See_Before_You_Die)), so I watched the rest, and I wish I hadn't. I can see what they were trying to do, but it didn't work for me. The amount of plot and character development in this could have been shown in 10 minutes. The rest of the time it's just squinting at a grainy picture trying to see anything that might be scary while trying not to get physically ill from motion sickness.

    review: A movie that I avoided because I thought it would be too dern gruesome for me when I first saw trailers for it. It's not as scary as I thought (not after playing The Forest, at least), but after a certain point it turns into an underground version of a World War I movie with unrelenting hand-to-hand fighting for survival in muddy trenches during rain storms, with Alien and Predator mixed in, and there's a lot of screaming, and it's a strangely similar vibe to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, except with a _lot_ more blood and mud and glistening slime and Carrie-inspired costumes. Luckily it's too dark to see much, but unluckily you can't tell which character is which, either. In the end it was exhausting and less satisfying than most war movies, even with Max's "happy" American ending.

    review: I didn't expect so much of this movie to be slow and boring. It wasn't very gory either, contrary to the expectations built up for most of my life. Still, there's something about the characters and the grainy handheld footage that makes everything _feel_ gross. Interesting that it had a found-footage feel to it, in the sense that all the actors seemed to be improvising their lines. I could see some innovative quick-cut editing that's unusual for the time. Otherwise the non-stop screaming for the last half hour really got on my nerves, and not in the fun way it was supposed to.

    review: Not something I meant to watch, but it just happened to be on the front page of Amazon Prime one day. Surprisingly watchable for an old movie without much of a score. Like watching a play (it's also a play). Way more Renfield than I was expecting. Sort of a weird ending, though. It just stopped, almost mid-sentence. Apparently there was an epilogue that was cut when "the code" upturned Hollywood debauchery in the 30s, and it wasn't in Amazon's version.

    review: Well I finally watched it. I guess I'm obligated to say it was as good as everyone says it is? Although I imagine it was probably a lot more impactful in 1973. In 2023, the pacing is slow and everything looks and sounds fake. The demon's voice sounded like a literal cartoon voice actor, the least scary demon voice I've ever heard, bees or no bees. This is the drawback to watching older classics through modern jaded eyes--I've seen the tropes in The Exorcist done better a hundred times. Also, I don't think I'm supposed to think this, but I found the mom character fairly insufferable. I didn't think the priest's internal struggle with faith was shown very well. Max von Sydow wasn't in the movie enough (also, speaking of demons, he somehow looked exactly the same in this as he did in The Force Awakens).

    review: It's okay, but I got a bit bored in the middle of it. I never really liked the zombie craze. Zombies are gross and I don't like gross horror. But I kept hearing this one is a fresh take on zombies ... except it's not, really, is it? Besides it's on a train in a different language? Everything felt contrived, the zombies looked performative, and the number of times the plot depended on characters and situations being cartoonishly non-believable extended well beyond credible limits, so it was difficult to form any attachment to it. But it wasn't bad. I just never got emotionally invested in it, which is clearly what needed to happen for the bits at the end to land right.

    review: The urge to make fun of the younger generation is strong, but it's cute. Sort of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer vibe. Wish it had gotten to the hook much faster, because it took a good 30 minutes. One of those comedy movies where the joke (which _is_ pretty funny) only has enough material for a few minutes of SNL sketch comedy, but they stretched it into a full movie instead. But it's got some heartfelt moments and snorty laughs here and there. e.g. "Divide and survive!"

    review: I remember this as one of the spookiest horror movies I've ever seen, so when I saw Jaedia's review giving it only three stars (and describing it more as a courtroom drama, which I didn't remember _at all_) I had to rewatch it to see if I misremembered. I both did and didn't. What I remembered were the flashbacks, which I still think are pretty spooky and memorable. In re-watching, what I love is the juxtaposition of the skeptical and the spiritual. Personally I thought this was a better movie than The Exorcist. Good score, too.

    review: Always meant to see this one. As with most all Stephen King movie adaptations, it wasn't as good as the source material, but it wasn't bad. I didn't think it would work as a movie, since it's such an internal experience. The bit with his daughter wasn't in the short story at all, but I swear I remember it from _somewhere_. Maybe it was lifted from another King story, or it's possible I actually _have_ seen this movie before and didn't remember it. It's that kind of movie; the kind that holds your attention while you're watching it, but you forget it a day after watching it, unless you write something down like this to know that you watched it.

    review: One of those classic "Hammer horrors" you've heard about all your life, but never actually seen. (Maybe that's just me.) Anyway, it's another historical artifact movie--my parents would have been in their 20s watching this in theaters (except _my_ parents definitely wouldn't have been watching any Hammer horrors). It's Dracula again, except in color and even more melodramatic, with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. A surprisingly modern-sounding score toward the end. And great diction throughout--very soothing ASMR voices. Whatever happened to actors you could actually understand? I sound like my dad.

    review: It's a unique movie, I'll give it that. I thought it was an allegory for the longest time. Stilted, unbelievable dialog means it's pretty obvious not all is as it seems as soon as the two characters start talking. Felt like more of a play. But it's an intriguing mystery to try to guess what's going on. That's the main reason to watch, really. To see if you can correctly guess the ending. (I didn't, because nobody could, because it's out of nowhere.)

One of the so-called [_giallo_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giallo) genre flicks, a new term to me. Allegedly one of the best ones. I can see the origins of the 80s teen slasher in it, but unfortunately for me, I don't really like teen slashers, no matter how much teens generally deserve slashing. As with Black Sunday above, it's mainly an interesting historical artifact.

After that, there's a lot of screaming and, well, _wailing_, and it's hard to look away. A good find.

The value of such a movie in 2023 is more as a historical artifact than as an entertainment product. More for getting a better understanding of the homages in things like the FMV game Immortality, or for marvelling at just how much better everyone's pocket cell phone is for movie production than expensive late 50s studio equipment, or for grabbing samples to use in trippy EDM or Pink Floyd-style songs, or for falling asleep, because it has that "old timey" lo-fi 50s orchestral palette and distorted radio microphone sound that reminds you of the 13" black-and-white kitchen television you grew up with.
