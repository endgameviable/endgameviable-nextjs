    t: Elden Ring Blind Pt 1 - Character Creation, Introduction
    d: This series will go well beyond 200 episodes recorded over more than two months, so buckle up for the longest video game journey I've ever made. Creating a Hero character, and the game's introduction. We're Tarnished, and we've come to the Lands Between to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord. Arriving in the Chapel of Anticipation. Tarnished's Wizened Finger. A door that doesn't open from this side, curious. The Grafted Scion, which we're obviously not meant to beat (and I didn't). Waking up in a cave with some flasks.

    t: Elden Ring Blind Pt 2 - Cave of Knowledge, Limgrave
    d: Level 7. A Ghost in a chair told us to jump, so we jump down to the Cave of Knowledge and unlock a Lost Grace, go through the tutorial, and dispatch the Soldier of Goderick (1) at the end. It's all standard stuff, except that two-handing a weapon is totally different. We get a Strength! Gesture. We open the exit door, unlock another Grace that I didn't see the name of, pass by a locked Stonesword Key door we can't open, pick up a Finger Severer and Tarnished's Furled Finger, ride up an elevator, and get our first look at Limgrave. There's a Summoning Pool, and a Small Golden Effigy. Nearby, Varré the NPC wants to help, and tells us to follow the guidence of grace. Looking around a bit, fighting some Bats and Dragonflies.

A very hard boss that obviously isn't meant for me to fight at level 7, even with all my previous Souls experience, roughly a week after defeating the final boss in Demon's Souls, which was a whole lot easier. The Church of Elleh, Merchant Kalé, fighting Goderick's soldiers at the Gatefront Ruins.

    d: Level 7. Melina appears unexpectedly at the Grace, and offers to "play the role of maiden" for us, so we can "turn runes into strength." Stormgate, and battling a massive giant. (Actually it's a Troll, a descendent of giants, I think.) (I actually thought the Troll was a boss, but it wasn't.) Astonished at how crazy hard this game is right at the beginning, longing for the easy cakewalk of Demon's Souls. Melina again, Stormhill Shack, The Warmaster Shack, Warmaster Bernahl sells Ashes of War. +1 Strength, +1 Vigor.

I was frustrated at my character's lack of ranged damage, and having to stay in melee range with the boss all the time. And thus the Hero retired.

Marking a spot on an interesting-looking feature of the map in Limgrave and heading toward it. Falling down a cliff to find the Limgrave Tunnels. A surprise visit from Flying Dragon Agheel (1, ran away!). Crabs. Soldiers versus Demi-Humans. +1 Vigor, +1 Mind = Level 13.

Hard fighting against fire-breathing Banished Knights. Summoning Recusant Bernahl. Godskin Duo (4). Are you kidding me? You better believe I summoned Bernahl *and* my Mimic Tear for *that* nonsense. It was a million miles outside the reach of my character as a solo fight. Not to mention it was annoying just to run *to* the fight, so I definitely didn't want to make that run a hundred times.

Golden Seed, Golden Lightning Transmortion (incantation). In the end, I die to a surprise gotcha trap at the Ancient Dragon Apostle's Cookbook [4] that was impossible to see coming, and that's where I gave up in disgust for the night, thinking for sure that this area of the game was created by Internet trolls.

    d: Level 113. The boss at the end of Crumbling Farum Azula is, naturally, the Beast Clergyman, who I previously encountered in frenzied form at the Bestial Sactum ranting about Deathroots, and decided was completely impossible to beat. But his final form is even worse - Maliketh, the Black Blade (51, abandoned). Heavily edited video of four days of fighting during the week. During this time I upgraded many weapons (Pulley Bow +8 to +9, Godskin Peeler +18 to +24, Demi-Human Queen's Staff +16 to +17, Greatbow +0 to +13), and tried many different tactices, but Maliketh is a towering brick wall of nope for my character. I decided to do other things rather than waste my entire weekend of gaming time on him. But at least I got the Draconic Tree Sentinal (15) guarding the door, which dropped the Malformed Dragon gear set.

Looking for an "Erdtree Sentry" which, according to the Unseen Assassin note, has a torch to reveal the assassins in Ordina, Liturgical Town. I did some Googling to find a hint, and at first I thought it was one of the Tree Sentinels at the Capital Outskirts, which plainly carries a torch. But after dispatching them (so much easier then at the beginning of the game!), there was no torch, just a Guardian's Shield. Then I did some more Googling and found I had to go to the Hermit's Shack to buy the Sentry's Torch, which I somehow missed before. Then, crawling through the evergaol in Ordina, Liturgical Town to light the candles and dispel the seals, which was still an ordeal, even with a Sentry's Torch. Behind the seal is a portal, which led to Miquella's Haligtree, Haligtree Canopy (Grace). Stonesword Key.

Godskin Peeler +25 with Black Flame Tornado Ash of War and Mimic Tear for the first phase, switched to Keen Great Épée +25 with Repeating Thrusts Ash of War for the mostly solo second phase (although on the winning attempt, I actually switched to the Great Épée early in the first phase just to try something different). Wondrous Physick was Bubble Defense Thingy and Thorny Cracked Tear, which increases Attack Power on successive attacks. Leyndell, Ashen Capital. Ghost. +2 Dexterity (52) = Level 130.

My only strategy is to keep running toward the Shmoo and hit him a lot (roughly 75% of your time is spent running toward the boss because it's another Maliketh situation where they keep running away from you).

After trying different weapons, different shields, different Talismans, different Spirit Ashes, even co-op player summoning, in the end, I finally used a tip I found on a wiki and equipped the Rivers of Blood sword with the Corpse Piler move, which worked, once I discovered that the Corpse Piler had a 3-hit combo move. After five days of fighting, the winning boss fight took less than two minutes. Melania's Great Rune, Remembrance of the Rot Goddess. Roundtable Hold.
