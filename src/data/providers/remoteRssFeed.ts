// TODO: An idea to fetch entries from a remote feed,
// such as a YouTube channel feed.
// However this introduces a new issue:
// Fetching _and saving_ the entries locally somewhere.
// Basically this means adding some kind of persistent storage.
// A complicated problem that's probably too much to deal with now.
// But I'll want to attach some kind of persistence eventually.
